# Backend: Twitter-YouTube Project

Welcome to the **Backend Project**, a **production-ready backend** designed for a hybrid **Twitter-YouTube** platform. This backend allows users to upload videos, like the videos, and tweets, can add playlists, Watch History is maintained, can subscribe to other channels, and interact with data through optimized custom APIs. Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, the system leverages **MongoDB Atlas** for data storage and **Mongoose** for data modeling.

This project is fully optimized, rigorously tested with **Postman**, and ready for production. Note that the front-end for this project is yet to be developed.

## ‚ö° Features

- **Video Uploads**: Seamlessly upload videos and link them to a perfect author.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Handles errors in a structured way with meaningful messages.
- **Custom API Responses**: Provides consistent and well-structured API responses.
- **Optimized Data Models**: Data schemas designed with **Mongoose** to ensure high performance.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Data is securely stored and managed in **MongoDB Atlas** for scalability and reliability.
- **Tested and Production-Ready**: Thoroughly tested using **Postman** to ensure the API functions as expected in a production environment.

## üîß Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the backend API locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemantyadav8006/learning-backend.git
cd learning-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a **.env** file in the root directory and add the following:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=<Your_MongoDB_Atlas_Connection_String>
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=*

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=<your_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY> || 1d

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=5d

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET>
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

- The server will now be running on http://localhost:5000 (or whichever port you choose).

- Test the API with Postman
